                <p>I was born and raised in Omaha, Nebraska. My father is an American, and my mother was from Finland. Because of this, my sister and I got to go with our mother to Helsinki several times throughout our childhood to see the country of our heritage & get to know the trans-atlantic side of our family. Those were some of my happiest memories!</p>

            <div class="div-2">
                <p>One of my many passions is the arts. My entire youth was spent singing in choirs & musicals and acting in plays, and I have a BFA in Theater from The University of Nebraska. One of my other passions is animals. I'm a vegan animal rights activist, I take care of my neighborhood's feral cats, and I'm active with the TNR movement to limit the feral cat population.</p>

                <p><span>Random factoids:</span> I was diagnosed with Asperger's Syndrome at the age of 46! It was a blessing, as I can understand myself so much better now. I have a brown belt in Taekwondo. I was going for my black belt, but I got a career-ending injury before I could test. I've visited Mexico, Canada, Finland, Japan, and I once lived in the UK.</p>
